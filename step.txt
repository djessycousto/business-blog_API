becarefull with origin, 
iwas having trouble with
blog/v1/user/verification-email  =>app.use("/api-blog/v1", userRouter); 
i made a separate router for render app.use("/api-blog/v1", pagesRouter); 
where was  /api-blog/v1/user/verification-email 
that why it was not working when i brought it back to user i
it works is there a conflict ? i want to use it pages 


solution 
separate the 2
/api-blog/v1/user/verification-email 
/api-blog/v1/pages/user/verification-email  add pages
